     ‚≠êÔ∏è Exploring the rules of the decision tree üå≤
</h1>


- **Big idea** -- Machine learning models are difficult to understand. 
- **Small idea** -- Specifically, in understanding large decision tree models, "How the rules affect the the entity" is not possible right now with complex models.
- **Birds eye view of the idea** --  We plan to undo the complexity of the large decision tree model and explain what it means to make for the rest of the entities.
- **Technical details** --  Train a complex dataset (NBI) simple machine learning model such as decision tree. Using graphs / networks understand the rules of the decision tree.

### üéØ Objective
- The objective of this research study is to develop a method for explaining large decision rules and how it affects bridges. 
* We specifically try apply this technique on the National Bridge Inventory dataset.

### üí™ Challenge
- In the NBI dataset, it is a **challenge** to identify maintainance patterns and various factors that interact in explaining bridge performance and maintenance. Because, the use of `reconstruction_year` does not provide an valuable information about the type of repair or reconstruction done.

### üß™ Solution
- To address this challenge we can use bridge intervention matrix, that utilizes the bridge intervention matrix for `deck` to identify various types of intervention depending on the probability of the transition.
- With large set of complicated rules, it is difficult to understand the interactions.
- We use explainable methods such as decision trees.
- Identify the commonality between the bridges by visualizing the rules between the trees.
