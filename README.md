# Exploring the rules of the decision trees

## Introduction

- **Big idea** --  Machine learning models are difficult to understand. 
- **Small idea** --  Specifically, understanding, "How the rules affect the the entity" is not possible right now with complex models.
- **Birds eye view of the idea** --  We plan to undo the complexity of the machine learning model and explain what it means to make for the rest of the entities.
- **Technical details** --  Train a complex dataset (NBI) simple machine learning model such as decision tree. Using graphs / networks understand the rules of the decision tree.
