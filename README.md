  Exploring the rules of the decision tree using Graph objects
</h1>

- **Big idea** -- Machine learning models are difficult to explain and interpret.
- **Small idea** -- Especially, in understanding the insights offered by the large decision tree models, such as, "How the rules affect the the entity" is challenging with complex models.
- **Birds eye view of the idea** -- We plan to undo the complexity of the large decision tree model and explain the relationship of between the insight within the model with respect to the data. 
- **Technical details** --  Train a dataset on a simple machine learning model such as decision tree. Using graphs / networks understand the rules of the decision tree.
- **What's next** -- Often, there a networks results in formation of various clusters. The future direction can explore the possibilities in identifying similarity between the structures.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- The objective of this research study is to develop a method for intepreting the large decision rules and how it affects data samples. We demonstrate our techniques with the use of IRIS dataset. 

### ðŸ’ª Challenge
- In the real world dataset, it is a **challenge** to identify patterns and various factors that interact in explaining the decisions made for specific instance.

### ðŸ§ª Solution
- With large set of complicated rules, it is difficult to understand the interactions.
- We use explainable methods such as decision trees.
- Identify the commonality between the entities by visualizing the rules between the trees.
